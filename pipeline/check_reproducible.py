"""Assert that a fresh pipeline run reproduces the committed results.

The run is seeded, so every figure in public/data/pipeline_results.json comes
back the same on a given machine. It does NOT come back bit-identical across
machines: the Cox proportional hazards fit goes through an iterative optimiser,
and lifelines, scikit-learn and NumPy all sit on whatever BLAS the platform
ships. Those differ in the last few digits between Windows and Linux, which is
ordinary floating point, not a broken seed.

So the check is a tolerance, not an equality. RTOL is set far tighter than any
real change in an assumption would produce (retuning a lapse rate or a select
factor moves figures by percent, not by a thousandth of a percent) and far
looser than platform noise. Structure is still compared exactly: a new key, a
dropped key, or a changed string fails immediately.

This is what keeps the README honest. If someone retunes an assumption and
forgets to regenerate the JSON, the dashboard and the model start telling
different stories, and nothing else would catch it.

Usage: python check_reproducible.py   (run from pipeline/, after run_pipeline.py)
